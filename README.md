In order to run this model you should adapt the folder to their matched root direction and uncompress the dataset

Dataset used: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RLZypzqf43rWz3NLBcBqYJAsVpzhEyqp?usp=sharing
Some pretrained models: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1c-uteo-yph9yqzfyy9GVqDyzkVIsPy1M?usp=sharing

HOW TO RUN THE FILE MODEL

1- run the first imports and mount the google drive to have acces to the files
2- run the 20-50 DATASET section: (important to set the file paths properly)
      - to adjust the amount of data, you can change the value after // in the take_one_fourth function
3- run the MODEL section to create the model class and instantiate it
4- run the LOAD OUR PRETRAINED MODEL changing the file from which the model loads its weight to your 
desired. (important to set the file paths properly)
We have included many other models you can run


-All the other sections can be run, like for example the training sections and adjust the hyperparameters
